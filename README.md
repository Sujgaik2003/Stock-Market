<p id="description">Predicting stock market prices using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a popular application of deep learning in the finance domain. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can capture sequential patterns and is well-suited for time-series data like stock prices.</p>
